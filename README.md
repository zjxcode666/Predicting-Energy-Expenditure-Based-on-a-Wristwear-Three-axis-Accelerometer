# Predicting-Energy-Expenditure-Based-on-a-Wristwear-Three-axis-Accelerometer
In this project, a total of 100 subjects aged 18–30 years participated. 
Each participant wore a triaxial accelerometer, COSMED Quark pulmonary function tester (Quark PFT), and heart rate band at the same time, and completed the tasks of walking (speed range: 2 km/h, 3 km/h, 4 km/h, 5 km/h, 6 km/h) and running (speed range: 7 km/h, 8 km/h, 9 km/h) sequentially. 
The ANN prediction models were built using accelerometer data as the independent variable and the metabolic equivalents (METs) as the dependent variable.
